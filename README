QT4 spec for Linux => Win32 cross compilation
=============================================

To use just copy (or symlink) the dir to 
/usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linuxtowin32-cross or whereever QT4  is installed.

Then setup the following QMAKE properties :
QTWIN32_INSTALL_BINS    - Where are the Win32 QT-binaries (moc, qmake etc.)
QTWIN32_INSTALL_HEADERS - Where are the win31 QT-headers
QTWIN32_INSTALL_LIBS    - Where are the Win32 QT-dlls

Setup using "qmake -set <property> <value"

Then just run "qmake -spec linuxtowin32-cross" in your project dir to generate
the makefiles.

A minor glitch is that the librarynames used for linking is not correct. So
the makefiles generated will not link correctly. The dlls are on Win32 does not 
contains the postfixed number - fx. QtGui4, and QtCore4. Instead they are just
without the number - fx. QtGui and QtCore. This minor details must as of now be
changed manually in the makefile.
